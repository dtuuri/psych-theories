# psych-theories
This project will collect various information about psychological and motivational theories that I found interesting.

It's important to note that I'm not formally trained in any of these theories and don't represent myself as an expert. These are just various items I've encountered over the years that I have found interesting or beneficial in my work. The project will start by just maintaining a list of various items, eventually I help to enhance by tagging with specific examples of how or where this knowledge could be beneficial.

If you have questions, just reach out, or get in contact with me via LinkedIn - Dan Tuuri.
